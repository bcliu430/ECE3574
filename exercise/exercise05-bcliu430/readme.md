Exercise 05: Word Count
------------------------

The goal of this exercise is to learn how to look for useful parts of the standard library and how to use it generally.

In a file named wordcount.cpp write a program that reads all the words from a text file name "prose.txt", counting how many times each word appears, sorting them from the most frequently appearing to least, then writing to standard out the top 10 most frequently used words.

* Consider a word any space-separated string. 
* **Leverage the standard library as much as possible**.
* For the purpose of this exercise you can skimp on error checking.
